# üåø Mycelia

[Live Project ‚Üí https://mycelia.solla.dev](https://mycelia.solla.dev)

**Mycelia** is my personal Web3 exploration playground ‚Äî a decentralized application (dApp) sandbox built with modern frontend technologies and evolving Web3 standards.

It‚Äôs a space where I experiment with blockchain concepts, wallet connections, decentralized interactions, and multi-chain possibilities ‚Äî starting with the Ethereum ecosystem and expanding progressively.

> Like a mycelial network, this project will organically expand across chains, technologies, and ideas.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (planned for future UI iterations)
- **State Management & Blockchain Interaction:** [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) + [viem](https://viem.sh/)
- **Wallet Connections:**
  - Injected wallets (MetaMask, Brave, etc.)
  - WalletConnect v2 (mobile wallets like Rainbow, Trust, MetaMask Mobile)
- **Data Sources:**
  - **[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/):** to fetch which tokens a wallet currently holds and get token metadata.
  - **[DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/):** to fetch current token prices in USD.
  - **[TrustWallet Token Assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets):** used for fallback token logos.
- **Request & Cache Management:** [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query) handles all remote request state and caching.
- **Token Balance Syncing:** [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) `useReadContracts` and `useBalance` keep balances updated in real time.
- **Blockchain Ecosystem (Phase 1):**
  - Ethereum Mainnet
- **Hosting & Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Version Control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/franciscosolla/mycelia)

## ‚úÖ Current Capabilities

- Connect wallet
- Discover which tokens the connected wallet holds (via Alchemy)
- Fetch metadata (name, symbol, decimals, logo) for each token (via Alchemy)
- Read token balances live from the blockchain using wagmi + viem
- Fetch token prices in USD (via DeFiLlama)
- Display total wallet balance and per-token balances on Ethereum Mainnet

## üìÅ Folder Structure

To keep things focused and flexible in early development, Mycelia currently uses a simplified structure:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js App Router (routes + layout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # All shared and page-level UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Custom reusable React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/              # External service clients and utilities (e.g., Alchemy)
public/               # Static assets (icons, favicons, images)
```

This allows quick iteration and low overhead. More structure can be introduced as the app evolves.

## üßÄ Project Vision

**Mycelia** is intended to be a continuously evolving project:

- **Start:** Connecting wallets, handling wallet sessions, chain detection.
- **Next:** Interacting with smart contracts (reading/writing).
- **Later:** Expanding multi-chain support beyond EVM (e.g., Solana, Cosmos).
- **End Goal:** Build a clean, modular, open-ended Web3 playground that can serve as a strong professional showcase of decentralized frontend engineering best practices.

## üìã Project Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create `.env.local` file

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your-reown-cloud-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your-alchemy-api-key
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## üéØ Development Principles

- **Minimal abstractions first**, polish UX incrementally.
- **Decentralization-first thinking**: wallet connections, self-custody, multi-network support.
- **Professional code quality**: strongly typed, testable, clean separation of concerns.
- **Learning and exploration-driven**: Mycelia will evolve based on my interests and Web3 frontier developments.

## üìñ Roadmap (Next Steps)

- [ ] Add ENS name resolution and avatar fetch
- [ ] Support custom network switching
- [ ] Implement smart contract read operations
- [ ] Add cross-chain metadata fetching (NFTs, tokens)
- [ ] Later: Introduce Solana wallet connection flow
