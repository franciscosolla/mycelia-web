# Mycelia

**Mycelia** is a personal blockchain learning playground — a dApp built with Next.js and ethers.js, designed to grow as I explore and learn more about crypto, DeFi, and decentralized protocols.

> Like a mycelial network, this project will organically expand across chains, technologies, and ideas.
