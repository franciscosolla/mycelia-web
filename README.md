# ðŸŒ¿ Mycelia

[Live Project â†’ https://mycelia.solla.dev](https://mycelia.solla.dev)

**Mycelia** is my personal Web3 exploration playground â€” a decentralized application (dApp) sandbox built with modern frontend technologies and evolving Web3 standards.

Itâ€™s a space where I experiment with blockchain concepts, wallet connections, decentralized interactions, and multi-chain possibilities â€” starting with the Ethereum ecosystem and expanding progressively.

> Like a mycelial network, this project will organically expand across chains, technologies, and ideas.

## ðŸ§€ Project Vision

**Mycelia** is intended to be a continuously evolving project:

- **Start:** Connecting wallets, handling wallet sessions, chain detection.
- **Next:** Interacting with smart contracts (reading/writing).
- **Later:** Expanding multi-chain support beyond EVM (e.g., Solana, Cosmos).
- **End Goal:** Build a clean, modular, open-ended Web3 playground that can serve as a strong professional showcase of decentralized frontend engineering best practices.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create `.env.local` file

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-walletconnect-cloud-project-id
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Principles

- **Minimal abstractions first**, polish UX incrementally.
- **Decentralization-first thinking**: wallet connections, self-custody, multi-network support.
- **Professional code quality**: strongly typed, testable, clean separation of concerns.
- **Learning and exploration-driven**: Mycelia will evolve based on my interests and Web3 frontier developments.

## ðŸ“– Roadmap (Next Steps)

- [ ] Add ENS name resolution and avatar fetch
- [ ] Support custom network switching
- [ ] Implement smart contract read operations
- [ ] Add cross-chain metadata fetching (NFTs, tokens)
- [ ] Later: Introduce Solana wallet connection flow
